#Amateur Photo Library

Just a simple photo tool for myself. I used to put the photo everywhere on my disk / NAS / share folder. Meanwhile, I can't use iPhoto on Mac, since I had XX GB Files.


## Major Feature

* Simple user interface to preview the photo
  * See EXIF information
  * Go to the place of Phoho
  * Show avaiable format of current photo.
* Photo Organizer Features
  * In order to save disk space, find duplicated photo by File name and Hash.
  * Organize photo by Date, now it's fixed "/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/...."
  * Put the difffernt format in same folder
  * Save hash and information into database (SQLite), it could be searched from UI or CLI
